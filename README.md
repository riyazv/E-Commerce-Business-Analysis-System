# E-Commerce-Business-Analysis-System

This project is a comprehensive C++-based data analysis system developed for a university assignment under the module Data Structures (CT077-3-2-DSTR). The system processes, analyzes, and compares e-commerce transaction and review data using both array and linked list data structures.
🔧 Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleans transaction and review datasets by trimming whitespace, filtering invalid rows, and preparing data for analysis.
•	Sorting Algorithms:
o	Array-based QuickSort to sort transactions by date.
o	Linked List-based MergeSort for efficient non-contiguous sorting.
•	Search Algorithms:
o	Linear search for identifying electronics purchases with credit card payments.
o	Hash Table with Linked List chaining for fast lookup and collision handling.
•	Review Analysis:
o	Word frequency analysis on 1-star product reviews using both array hash tables and linked list hash tables.
•	Performance Testing:
o	Benchmarks time and memory usage across multiple runs.
o	Outputs comparisons between array and linked list performance.
📁 Input Files
•	transactions.csv: Contains e-commerce transaction data.
•	reviews.csv: Contains product review data.
📌 Technologies Used
•	C++
•	Git & GitHub for version control
•	Standard Template Library (STL) for I/O, string manipulation, and performance measurement
📈 Performance Comparison
The system allows users to compare the performance of:
•	Array vs Linked List in search and sort operations
•	Hash table implementations for frequency analysis
